# SolarSystem-Simulation
A Solar System Simulation made with Python, it has collision and gravitational pull simulation with asteroids.

I would like to further improve it by adding textures, better animations, and a better gravity simulation. I tried adding textures in C++ using OpenGL, but the collision implementation was much more complicated.

## Requirements
It is required to have 'pygame'. It can be installed with the following command:

`pip install pygame`

## Install
Simply run `python3 main.py`
